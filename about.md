I'm Seth Polsley, a Masters student at Texas A&M University.  I enjoy studying the science behind real-world processes that rely heavily on our human ability to learn (speech, vision, recognition, etc.) and the engineering methods used to model them.  I hope to research more in the area of "intelligent systems" which can use these models, alongside artificial intelligence and machine-learning techniques, to build computers that are able to interact more naturally with people.  As an example of some of the types of systems that interest me, check out this [KU Journal article][ku-journal-article] I wrote as part of my undergraduate research.  Currently, my [GitHub page][github-page] has a variety of projects as well, with many of them relating to artificial intelligence in some way.  Over my Masters program, I hope to be adding some more interesting projects in the future.
