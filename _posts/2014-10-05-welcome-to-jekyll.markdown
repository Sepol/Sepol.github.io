I thought it'd be a fun idea to make a small GitHub page with more info about me.  I'm a Masters student at Texas A&M University, and my research interests could be defined very generally as "intelligent systems."  To me this means creating computer systems that can operate in different environments and learn to understand the information around them, much in the same way as we learn about our surroundings.

Feel free to check out my [GitHub repos][github-repos] for a sense of the type of projects I often do.  There's a bit of a mix: some of them were written for classes, but many were purely for fun.  I think it's safe to say a lot of them are related to artificial intelligence or signal processing topics in some way.  I have more ideas for future projects that I hope to be sharing on GitHub soon!
