I decided to make a jekyll-powered IO page on Github, mostly for fun and learning.  I'd like to use this space to jot down some thoughts and blog about interesting topics, mostly tech-related.  Updates will likely be irregular, but feel free to check out the other links across the top of the page to learn more about my projects, papers, and activities.

My [GitHub page][github-repos] is a good place to get an overview of the type of projects I often do.  There's a bit of a mix: some of them were written for classes, but many were purely for fun.  I think it's safe to say a lot of them are related to artificial intelligence or signal processing topics in some way.  I have more ideas for future projects that I hope to be sharing on GitHub soon!
